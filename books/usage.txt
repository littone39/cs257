NAME
books.py -- program that searches a database of books 

SYNOPSIS 
usage: python3 books.py [-a | -b | -y| -h] [search_string1] [search_string2]

DESCRIPTION
This program allows users to search a database of books. Users specify a category and 
a string to search in that category. The program will print a list of books containing the 
string in the corresponding category. 
Invalid option choice or incorrect number of arguments for one of the search types will 
result in an error usage statement. 

options: 
     [-a | -t | -y| -h] flag that specifies what aspect of the book details the user is searching. 
        -a or --author  searches book authors containing search_string1
        -b or --book    searches book titles containing search_string1. If no search_string is specified,
                        all books will be returned sorted alphabetically by title. 
        -y or --year    searches for books published between years search_string1-search_string2. 
                        If no years are specified, the program will return all books sorted by 
                        publication date. If start year only is specified, all books published on or after 
                        that year will be returned, and if end year only is specified all books published 
                        on or before will be returned.
        -h or --help    prints out this usage statement (no further arguments). Default if 
                        no category is specified.
        
    [search_string1] Specifies search for [-a | -b | -y]. Use 'quotes' to search for strings containing spaces.

    [search_string2] Valid for use as the end range of publication dates with -y, 
            or as a second tag in books to specify sort type.
