NAME
books.py -- program that searches a database of books 

SYNOPSIS 
usage: python3 books.py [-a | -b | -y| -h] [search_term1] [search_term2]

DESCRIPTION
This program allows users to search a database of books. Users specify whether to search for books or
authors and the program will return a list of the books or authors that match the search. Users can specify
multiple searches (e.g. python3 books.py -a bront -b wuth will print a list of authors that contain 'bront'
followed by a list of books that contain 'wuth' in the title.)
Invalid option choice or incorrect number of arguments for one of the search types will 
result in an error or printing of this usage statement. 

options: 
     [-a | -t | -y| -h] flag that specifies what aspect of the book details the user is searching. 
        -a or --author  searches book authors containing search_term1. If no search_term1 is specified,
                        the program will print a list of all authors.
        -b or --book    searches for books containing search_term1 in the title. By default the program
                        will print the resulting books alphabetically by title. The user can choose to sort
                        books by publication year by specifying search_term2 as the string year. If 
                        search_term1 is not specified, the program will print all books. To 
                        print all books sorted by year, enter the empty string '' in place of search_string1 
                        and year as search_term2 (e.g. python3 books.py '' year). 
        -y or --year    searches for books published between years search_term1-search_term2. 
                        If no years are specified, the program will return all books sorted by 
                        publication date. If start year only is specified, all books published on or after 
                        that year will be returned, and if end year only is specified 
                        (e.g. python3 books.py -y None 2000) all books published on or before will 
                        be returned.
        -h or --help    prints out this usage statement (no further arguments). Default if 
                        no category is specified.
        
    [search_term1] Specifies search for [-a | -b | -y]. Use 'quotes' to search for strings containing spaces.

    [search_term2] Valid for use as the end range of publication dates with -y, 
            or as a second tag in books to specify sort type.
