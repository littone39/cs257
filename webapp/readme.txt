DATA: World Happiness Report 2005-2021. Includes information from Gallup Poll about
country happiness (life ladder), gdp, social support, and other related statistics over
time.

FEATURES CURRENTLY WORKING:
- Click on a country to view a table with information for that country
from World happiness report
- create a chart that plots each country as an individual dot
- navigate to graph, map, or home using the navbar

FEATURES NOT YET WORKING:
- title and x-axis scale 
- some of the countries have different names in the datamaps documentation -- need 
to add a table to sql to link the abbreviations and country names from our database
to datamaps
- descriptions of the variables/short description of what does the data mean 
and link to World Happiness Report for more information
- short description of the generated chart (what are all the dots??)
- code: fix api endpoints to make more sense with our data and remove unnecessary functions
from js. 
Ideally we will add:
- country map color coded -- happiest countries darker, less happy countries lighter
- hover over plotted points to see country name
