DESCRIPTION 
User specifies a flag and a search_term that will produce a list of results to be printed to the screen. 
No flag or search_term will print this usage statement. Multiple or unexpected search_term(s) will result 
in an error message. If the user specifies more than one flag, the program will return only the results for 
the first flag present in this order: (-a, -m, -e). The usage statement will be printed if no flag is 
specified. search_term is case-insensitive. 

options: 
    [-a | -m | -e | -h]

    -a or --athletes returns a list of athletes that competed for a specified NOC. Use search_term to 
            specify which NOC user would like to see athletes. If no search_term is specified,
            the program will print an error message and this usage statement.
    -m or --medals returns a list of NOCs and the number of a specified medal type each NOC won. 
            Specify search_term as 'Gold', 'Silver', or 'Bronze' (case insensitive)
            to view medal count for specified medal color for all NOCs in descending order of medals earned. 
            If search_term is not one of those options, program will print an error message and 
            this usage statement. Program default will list count of gold medals for each NOC if 
            no search_term is specified.
    -e or --events will return a list of events for a specified sport. if search_term is not a 
            valid sport, the list will be empty. No search_term will print an error message and this 
            usage statement.
    -h or --help or no flag will print out this usage statement.
